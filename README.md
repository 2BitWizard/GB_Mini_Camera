# GB_Micro_Camera
A smaller flashable version of the original GameBoy Camera

This project may still receive updates. The current release (1.3) has been produced, assembled and tested.
While earlier prototypes and this current 1.3 release have all worked for me, I can't guarantee their working.
Assemble and use at your own risk. It is extremely easy to damage the MAC-GBD, FRAM and flash chip during assembly.
