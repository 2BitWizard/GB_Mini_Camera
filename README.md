# GB_Mini_Camera
A smaller flashable version of the original GameBoy Camera

This project may still receive updates. The current release (1.3) has been produced, assembled and tested.
While earlier prototypes and this 1.3 release have all worked for me, I can't guarantee their working.
Assemble and use at your own risk. It is extremely easy to damage the MAC-GBD, FRAM and flash chip during assembly.

Note on assembly of the board. If you're using a new 3V0 regulator from the BOM list, the C16 capacitor will not be necessary. Unlike the original 3V0 regulator, the pin connected to this capacitor is NC on the new 3V0 regulator.

IMPORTANT note:
Some GameBoy cameras have the U4 regulator populated instead of the U5 regulator. My board is designed to work with either the regulator linked in the BOM (recommended) or the U5 regulator harvested from the original camera cart. U4 will not work.
